   To answer which driver is most efficient, you need to use our sophisticated formula for driver's KPI.

    On-time Rate (50%): Places the highest importance on timely deliveries.
    Rejection Rate (20%): Emphasizes the importance of reducing rejected deliveries by considering it inversely.
    Finished-in-Area Rate (20%): Highlights the importance of completing deliveries within the designated area.
    Within Planned Distance Rate (10%): Encourages adherence to planned routes and distance efficiency.

The KPI formula combines these components to give a weighted score that reflects a driver's overall performance, 
taking into account timeliness, reliability, effectiveness in specific areas, and route efficiency. 
This comprehensive approach ensures that drivers are evaluated on multiple critical aspects of their job performance
